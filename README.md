# Collaboration-of-Multiple-Agents-for-Exploration-and-Mapping

Introduction:

People have long dreamt about machines having abilities to perceive and understand the environment
and react intelligently towards it. This gave rise to the field currently known as robotics.
Initially, started under the notion of Artificial Intelligence this field gained relevance and in the
early 90s when people started noticing patterns in natural behaviour which could be replicated
easily in machines. One such phenomenon was the collective and collaborative behaviour of
natural beings like ants, bees and fishes to achieve tasks which when other done alone would be
utterly impossible. This set phenomenon gave rise to the field of robotics known as *Cooperative
Multi Agent Robot Systems* or in layman terms *Swarm Robot Systems.*
